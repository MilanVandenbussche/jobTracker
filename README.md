This small project is part of our recruitment process for our QA-role. It's a small project to get to know you better.

## The Assignment
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Manual testing
- Automated testing

Are the two main topics of this assignment. We want you to write tests for the following code. You can use any testing framework you want. We're using [phpunit](https://phpunit.de/), but you can use any framework you want.

We're not looking for the perfect solution, but we're looking for a solution that shows us how you think and how you work. We're looking for a solution that shows us your skills and your creativity. We're looking for a solution that shows us who you are.

After all your work, we'd love to see a small report of what you did and why you did it. We'd love to see your thoughts and your ideas. We'd love to see your creativity.

## How to get started
- Fork this repository
- Clone your fork
- Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`
- Create a database and fill in the database credentials in the `.env` file
    ```
  What I used to create this project on my local machine was MAMP.
  You can use whatever you want, but I recommend using MAMP or WAMP.
  ```
    - The variable `DB_DATABASE` should be the name of the database you created
- Run `composer install`
- Run `npm install`
- Run `php artisan storage:link`
- Run `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`

## How to start the project and submit your work
- Make sure your on the branch called `Original`
- Create a new branch, this branch should be prefixed with `feature` or `bugfix` depending on what you're doing, as well with your name. For example: `feature-<your-name>`
- Write your tests
- Commit your changes
- Push your changes
